# CanabisWeb
NOTE; This project is a demonstration of my skills in programming, self taught, and web development. I have 2 partners(my sister and my friend). Also, it is made for university portfolio and interview.

Welcome to my first project on Github! I started this project on my sister's vision upon her Canabis business by creating an E-commerce website that provides many types of weed and related products.

## First Step
Me and my sister, we had a conversation about web design before deciding what to do next. I planned all my ideas with my sister on Figma and created an amazing style website.

## Progression
I was so struggled coding by myself(at that time, I learn to code HTML/CSS). I made a really good job on it(IMO) but it wasn't enough and I didn't know how to do database SQL bla bla bla. Luckily, I met a friend named "Farn". He taught me to code PHP stuffs and Database critical thinking. It worked out so well and I learned a lot from him, we had a great time together everyday in discord server.

## What can my website possibly do
You cannot do purchasing yet, you gotta login first by that u have to sign up first. After that, you can click on Browse to buy products on my website and click again on Cart at top right to key in ur details and finish payment.
